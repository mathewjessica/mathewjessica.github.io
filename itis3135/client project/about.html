        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <div class="about-container">
            <p>
                At the UNC Charlotte Catholic Campus Ministry (CCM), we are a vibrant community of students passionate about
                living out our Catholic faith. Our ministry is a place where students from diverse backgrounds come together
                to grow in their spiritual journey, build lasting friendships, and serve the greater community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is simple yet profound: to create a welcoming, supportive, and dynamic environment where
                students can explore and deepen their faith, all while making meaningful connections with others who share
                the same values. Whether you're a lifelong Catholic or someone looking to explore your faith, CCM is a place
                where you can belong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through regular Mass, Bible studies, retreats, volunteer opportunities, and fellowship events, we offer
                numerous ways for students to engage, connect, and grow. Our community is committed to fostering an
                inclusive space where everyone feels welcomed, loved, and encouraged to pursue a deeper relationship with
                God.
            </p>
            <p>
                At CCM, you’ll find more than just a ministry; you’ll find a family of students dedicated to supporting each
                other, both in faith and in life. We invite you to join us, get involved, and be part of a transformative
                experience that will enrich your time at UNC Charlotte.
            </p>
